# implement a search engine (embeddings)
#   accepts a collection of docs (input)
#   provides API to search over this collection by text query (fast api?)(end product)

# get a pretrained model from huggingface -calc vector representations
#   vector storage + retrival -> some library
#   do an example on any source (report)

# 1.import a pretrained model
# 2. make it accept input = multiple documents
# 3. make it generate embdeddings for the documents
# 4. make it search with a text query
# 4. build api around it
