The Industrial Revolution was a period of profound technological and social change that began in Great Britain in the late 18th century and spread throughout the world. It marked the transition from agrarian, handicraft-based economies to economies dominated by industry and machine manufacturing. This transformation was driven by a series of key inventions, most notably the steam engine, perfected by James Watt, which provided a new source of power for factories and transportation.

The impact on society was immense. The rise of the factory system led to mass migration from rural areas to urban centres, resulting in the rapid growth of cities. While this created new economic opportunities, it also led to difficult living and working conditions for many, with long hours, low wages, and overcrowded housing. The era also saw the emergence of a new social structure, with a growing industrial working class and a new middle class of factory owners, engineers, and professionals. The Industrial Revolution fundamentally reshaped the modern world, setting the stage for subsequent technological advancements and the global capitalist economy.
