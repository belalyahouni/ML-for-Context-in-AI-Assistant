A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing—no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. They are typically formed from the remnants of massive stars that die in a supernova explosion. If the core's mass is great enough, gravity overwhelms all other forces and collapses the core into an infinitely dense point known as a singularity.

The boundary beyond which escape is impossible is called the event horizon. It is not a physical surface, but rather a one-way membrane; objects can fall into it, but nothing can ever come out. The gravitational pull is so immense because all the object's mass is concentrated in the singularity. This extreme mass warps spacetime around it, creating a deep "gravitational well." Time itself is distorted near a black hole, with time passing more slowly for an observer closer to the event horizon compared to an observer farther away. While we cannot see black holes directly, we can infer their presence by observing their effect on nearby matter, such as stars orbiting an empty point in space.
