The internet's origins can be traced back to the 1960s as a United States military project called ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network). The goal was to create a decentralised, robust communications network that could withstand a nuclear attack. The first successful message was sent between two computers at UCLA and Stanford in 1969. A key innovation was packet switching, a method of breaking down data into small blocks, or packets, that could be sent independently over various routes and reassembled at the destination.

The 1980s saw the standardisation of the TCP/IP protocol, which remains the fundamental communication language of the internet. However, it was the invention of the World Wide Web by British scientist Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1990 that transformed the internet from a niche academic and military tool into a global platform for information sharing. He developed HTML, URLs, and HTTP, the foundational technologies for creating and accessing websites. The release of the first user-friendly web browser, Mosaic, in 1993, made the web accessible to the general public, sparking a boom that led to the commercialised, ubiquitous internet we know today.
